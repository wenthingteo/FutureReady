## Problem Statement

But in reality? It’s messy, repetitive, and time-consuming.
- Teams spend 40% of their time on manual planning & reporting.-
- Marketers juggle multiple platforms (Meta, LinkedIn, TikTok, Google Ads).
- Ad budgets leak without clarity on ROI.
- Insights are scattered and hard to act on.

Marketers waste hours — and still can’t tell what’s actually working.
